# Release notes

Create one file named `vX.Y.Z.md` for every source release. Start it with a
`## Changelog` section and describe functional changes, security impact,
affected consumers, compatibility or migration requirements, the checks that
ran, and the support and end-of-life window. Name the reviewed source commit
and release workflow when documenting verification.

The release workflow requires the tag-specific file, publishes it inside the
source archive, publishes the checksum and manifest assets, and creates a
GitHub build attestation for those assets. Keep release notes descriptive and
review them together with the code before creating the tag.
